This is an example of how the app will (or at least should) work

>>> python3 app.py 25 5 4 30 2

the app will start a pomodoro timer
25 -> the amount of minutes of concentration
5 -> the amount of minutes of the break
4 -> the amount of times this cycle will repeat until a long break
30 -> the amount of minutes the longe break will take
2 -> the amount of times this whole thing will run

In this example we have this cycle running

25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 30
25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 25 - 5 - 30

This cycle took 5 hours to finish
